*** Using CVS                                           ***
***********************************************************

If this is a CVS snapshot you have to perform some steps yourself
to get a complete VDRAdmin-AM folder:

1) Always call "./make.sh cvs" after every "cvs checkout" or
   "cvs update". At the moment this will only create some links
	 but might do more in the future.

2) The CVS checkout contains no locales (.mo files). You have
   create them yourself if you want to use a language other than
	 English: ./make.sh po
	 Please note that you need the "msgfmt" utility for this!

***********************************************************
*** Installation                                        ***
***********************************************************

1)  Unpack the archive somewhere:
    $ tar xvjf vdradmin-am-VERSION.tar.bz2
    $ cd vdradmin-am-VERSION

2)  If you want to run VDRAdmin-AM using a language other than set on
    your system, then before running it you have to issue:
    $ export LANG="<language code>"

    Where <language code> has to be one of: de_DE, es_ES, fi_FI, fr_FR,
		nl_NL or ru_RU (en_GB is default).

3)  Check if your system provides all requirements and optionally install
    the missing Perl modules:
    $ ./make.sh check 

4)  Now you have to deside wether you want to run VDRAdmin-AM locally (4a)
    in this directory or install it into your system (4b).

4a) run locally (=no installation)
    First you have to configure VDRAdmin-AM. This only has to be done once.
    $ ./vdradmind.pl --config

    Some questions about the configuration will be asked.

    Now you're done and you can run VDRAdmin-AM:
    $ ./vdradmind.pl

4b) install into system
    $ ./make.sh install

    Some questions about the configuration will asked.

    Now you're done and you can run VDRAdmin-AM:
    $ vdradmind.pl

5)  If you want VDRAdmin-AM to run automatically on system boot, you have
    to add a startup script to the wanted runlevel. Please consult your
    Linux distribution's documentation.
    Please also note that you might have to set the wanted language in
    that startup as shown in (2).

6)  No matter how you run VDRAdmin-AM, you now can point your browser to
    the given parameters (e.g. http://localhost:8001).


***********************************************************
*** Removing VDRAdmin-AM from your system               ***
***********************************************************

1)  Uninstall depends on the kind of installation you did:

1a) run locally (=no installation)
    There is not much to do.
    Simply remove to folder VDRAdmin-AM has been created while unpacking:
    $ rm -rf vdradmin-am-VERSION

1b) installed to your system
    You need the unpacked VDRAdmin-AM archive.
    $ cd vdradmin-am-VERSION
    $ ./make.sh uninstall

    You might want to delete your VDRAdmin-AM's configuration files:
    $ rm -rf /etc/vdradmin

    This of course only works if you didn't change the default install
    locations! If you've change them you must call "./make.sh uninstall"
		with those locations.
    If you don't know what I'm talking about, you probably didn't change
    the default values ;)

2)  You're done!


***********************************************************
*** Hide VDRAdmin-AM behind apache                      ***
***********************************************************

  you will need apache with mod_proxy and these lines in httpd.conf:

  <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPass /vdradmin/ http://127.0.0.1:8001/
  </IfModule>


***********************************************************
*** Hint from Martin Neuditschko for apache2 (untested) ***
***********************************************************

  I have summarized the needed changes for my Apache (Apache2, SuSE 8.2):
  Following modules have to be activated additionally:
  proxy, html_proxy, rewrite

  Following has to be added to the httpd.conf:
  <VirtualHost *>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^/vdradmin(.*) http://localhost:8001$1 [P,L]
  </VirtualHost>


***********************************************************
*** See who's calling (you need an ISDN card for this)  ***
***********************************************************

  Insert this in your isdn.conf:

  [MSN]
  NUMBER = <yourmsn>
  START = {
    [FLAG]
    FLAGS = I|O|R
    PROGRAM = /path/to/vdradmind.pl --displaycall "Call from \$2"
  }

  Restart isdnlog.
